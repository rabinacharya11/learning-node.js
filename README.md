# Project 1 Of Learning Node.js

This is the project which gets me started with node.js development for the projects that i would create in the future. 

The main reason to learn the node.js is to create a backend for my side projects or indie projects. 

Recently, I left the job due to some personal issues and in such phase I couldn't dedicate full-time working hours to full time job. 

The another reason to learn node.js is to diverse my employment opportunities in the job market.

Having the indepth experience of Flutter and Dart, the additional skill of node.js will make me more capable of job market. 

PS: If one of my indie project takes off, what if i never have to do the job of applying instead jobs of hiring!


## To Run the backend 

```shell 

npm i 
npm start
```

## To test the backend 
```shell 
npm i 
npm test
```
